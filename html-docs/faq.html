That is,
              Subversion manages files and directories over time. A tree of files is placed into a
              central repository. The repository is much like an ordinary file server, except that
              it remembers every change ever made to your files and directories. This allows you to
              recover older versions of your data, or examine the history of how your data changed.
              In this regard, many people think of a version control system as a sort of
              "time machine".</p><p>Subversion can access its repository across networks, which allows it to be used
              by people on different computers. At some level, the ability for various people to
              modify and manage the same set of data from their respective locations fosters
              collaboration. Progress can occur more quickly without a single conduit through which
              all modifications must occur. And because the work is versioned, you need not fear
              that quality is the trade-off for losing that conduit&#8212;if some incorrect change is made
              to the data, just undo that change.</p><p>Some version control systems are also software configuration management (SCM)
              systems. These systems are specifically tailored to manage trees of source code, and
              have many features that are specific to software development&#8212;such as natively
              understanding programming languages, or supplying tools for building software.
              Subversion, however, is not one of these systems. It is a general system that can be
              used to manage any collection of files. For you, those files might be source code&#8212;for
              others, anything from grocery shopping lists to digital video mixdowns and beyond."</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">Version Control with Subversion</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div><p>

				provides horizontal diffs highlighting and files can be merged interactively with
				visualization and saving of the resulting output. xxdiff has features to assist in
				performing merge reviews/policing and can unmerge CVS conflicts in automatically merged file
				and display them as two files, to help resolve conflicts. xxdiff uses external diff programs
				to compute differences: works with GNU diff, SGI diff and ClearCase's cleardiff, and any
				other similar diff tools. More information and downloads can be found at the <a href="http://xxdiff.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">xxdiff Web Site</a>. </p></dd><dt><span class="term">
